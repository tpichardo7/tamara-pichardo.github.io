Drinking Water Contamination and Low Birth Weight in California: A Statistical Analysis    
**Advisor: Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou, ScD, MSPH**

### **Abstract**
**Objective:** To explore potential associations between low birth weight (LBW) and a drinking water contaminant (DWC) index in California.     
**Background:** Exposure to various drinking water contaminants has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Low birthweight disparities persist and are a major determinant of chronic illnesses later in life. California has a wealth of publicly available environmental and health data. The 2021 CalEnviroScreen 4.0 report includes data on LBW and DWC. We hypothesized that there were distributional effects, latent effect modifiers, and nonlinear relationships between DWC, LBW, and covariates.     
**Methods:** Quantile regression, non-linear exposure response curves, and factor analysis (FA) were applied at the census tract level.   
**Results:** Crude and adjusted statistical analyses found null associations between LBW and DWC. Poverty and unemployment rate exhibited nonlinear relationships. Risk factors with distributional effects were poverty, marital status, foreign birth, and unemployment. FA regression suggested that systemic disparities in minority communities may explain disparities in LBW in California.   
**Conclusions:** SES factors are stronger predictors of LBW in California than the DWC index. Further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between LBW and DWC. Public health interventions for LBW should prioritize SES.

### **Introduction**

### **Methods**
#### Study Population
#### Exposure Assessment
#### Outcome Assessment
#### Covariates
#### Statistical Methods
##### *Quantile and OLS Regression*
##### *Non-Linear exposure response* curves
##### *Factor Analysis (FA) Regression*

### **Results**
#### Population Charactertics
The average LBW across all census tracts was low, at 5.0%, with a relatively wide range from 0-13.7%. The DWC indicator also shows wide variability, with a mean of 479.6 and a range of about 33-1,258. The covariate summaries reflect variability in reproductive, socioeconomic, and demographic factors across all tracts.
