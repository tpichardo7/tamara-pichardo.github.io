### **NBA Shot Visualization & Heatmap Analysis**   
**Description**: A data visualization that analyzes NBA shot selection and performance using player-level shot attempt coordinates for Lebron James, James Harden, and Steph Curry. The notebook produces multiple visual insights—including bar charts, standard shot charts, and spatial heatmaps—layered on top of a custom-drawn NBA court. The goal is to understand shot tendencies, efficiency, and spatial patterns. 

**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, data cleaning, coordinate-based shot chart visualization 

**Project Structure**: 

*   Notebook for data loading, cleaning, and visualization 
*   CSV file containing raw shot-level data  
*   Custom function for drawing NBA court graphics  
*   Output images: scatter shot chart, heatmap, hexbin map, distribution plots  

**Problem Statement**: How can we visually analyze a player's shooting tendencies across the court using coordinate data, and identify where shots are taken most frequently?

**Methodology**: 

*   Loaded and cleaned raw shot-level data (made vs. missed, shot type)  
*   Created exploratory visualizations (bar charts, pie charts)
*   Built a custom NBA court using matplotlib shapes (arcs, rectangles, circles)  
*   Plotted shot attempts to produce: 
    *   Scatter shot chart (made vs. missed)  
    *   Heatmap of shot density 
    *   Hexbin map for smoothed spatial density patterns

**Results**: 

*   Complete shot chart visualizing makes/misses across the entire court
*   Heatmap and hexbin visualizations highlighting high-volume shooting zones  
*   Contextual court background for clear spatial interpretation

**Future Improvements**: 

*   Add efficiency overlays (FG%, eFG% by zone)
*   Integrate player comparison mode (multiple players or seasons)
*   Add interactivity using Plotly Dash or Streamlit  
*   Build into a full web dashboard with filters for shot type, game, quarter, etc.
