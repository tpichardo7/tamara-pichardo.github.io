### **Machine Learning Model to Predict NCAA Football Game Outcomes**    
**Description**: This project builds a machine learning classifier to predict whether a college football team will win based on performance stats such as overall offensive efficiency per play, percentage of plays with positive EPA, percentage of explosive, high-impact plays, and percentage of failed or negative plays.

**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Machine learning (random forest), model evaluation, scikit-learn    

**Project Structure**:  

*   Jupyter notebook with EDA, modeling, and evaluation  
*   Raw and cleaned datasets  
*   Confusion matrix and visualizations 

**Problem Statement**: Can we predict the outcome of an NCAA football game using pre-game or team-level performance stats?  

**Methodology**:  

*    Cleaned and selected relevant features from historical stats  
*    Used logistic regression and random forest classifiers  

**Results**:  

*    Best model accuracy: 79%  
*    Confusion matrix showed better precision for predicting wins than losses  

**Future Improvements**:  

*    Test advanced models: incorporate XGBoost, gradient boosting, or neural networks and compare with baseline models   
*    Add player-level data: bring in stats such as rushing yards per attempt and sacks to improve prediction power   
*    Use real-time game data: try building an in-game win probability model using current drive stats (similar to ESPN’s Win Probability)
