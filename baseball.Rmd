### **Top 10 MLB Hitters of 2024: A Data-Driven Look**   
**Description**: pulled MLB player stats using MLB Stats API, filtered for top 10 based on hitting percentage and visualized via bar chart.   

**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Data wrangling, data visualization (matplotlib), MLB Stats API  

**Project Structure**: 

*   Jupyter notebook with data wrangling and visualization 
*   Bar chart output

**Problem Statement**: Who were the top 10 hitters last season based on advanced offensive metrics?

**Methodology**: 

*   Pulled full player-season dataset 
*   Filtered based on PA > X to remove small sample sizes  
*   Sorted by batting average 
*   Created bar chart to compare players

**Results**:  

*   Identified top 10 hitters with high offensive impact  
*   Visualized with clear, labeled bar chart

**Future Improvements**:

*   Add percentile ranks: show how top 10 hitters compare to league average 
*   Include defensive value: combine with defensive stats like DRS or UZR to create an overall value ranking 
*   Use interactive visuals: build interactive charts with Plotly for users to filter by team, stat, or position 
*   Add historical comparisons: see how the top 10 of this season compare with past seasons
